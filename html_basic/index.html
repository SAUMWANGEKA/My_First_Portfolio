  <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>This is my very first webpage created as part of my portfolio project.</p>
  <p>I am learning HTML to build cool and useful websites.</p>
  <p>This page contains different heading levels and paragraphs to show structure.</p>
  <p>I also included a clickable image linking to a site I like.</p>
